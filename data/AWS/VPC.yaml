  SC-7b: 18F utilizes the AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), which provides a private
    subnet within the AWS cloud. Each VPC is configured to utilize Routing Rules,
    Subnet Rules, and Security Group Rules. Each of these controls must have appropriate
    rules and routes in-place before any external service is able to reach a host
    within AWS.
