Once the droplet has been uploaded, STG messages end and DEA messages begin.\n\nFor example:\n\n2014-02-07T10:54:36.80-0800 [STG]     OUT -----> Downloading and installing node\nDEA\nThe Droplet Execution Agent emits DEA logs beginning when it starts or stops the app. These actions implement the desired state requested by the user. The DEA also emits messages when and app crashes.\n\nFor example:\n\n2014-02-13T11:44:52.07-0800 [DEA]     OUT Starting app instance (index 1) with guide e1ca6390-cf78-4fc7-9d86-5b7ed01e9c28\nRTR\nThe Router emits RTR logs when it routes HTTP requests to the application. Router messages include the application name followed by a Router timestamp and then selections from the HTTP request.\n\nFor example:\n\n2014-02-13T11:42:31.96-0800 [RTR]     OUT nifty-gui.example.com - [13/02/2014:19:42:31 +0000]\n\"GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1\" 404 23 \"-\" \"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_8_5) AppleWebKit/537.36\n(KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/32.0.1700.107 Safari/537.36\" 10.10.2.142:6609 response_time:0.004092262\napp_id:e1ca6390-cf78-4fc7-9d86-5b7ed01e9c28\nLGR\nLoggregator emits LGR to indicate problems with the logging process.

These isolated environments, or containers, can be limited in terms of CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, and network access. The only currently supported OS is Linux.\n\nEach application deployed to Cloud Foundry runs within its own self-contained environment, a Linux Warden container. Cloud Foundry operators can configure whether contained applications can or cannot directly interact with other applications or other Cloud Foundry system components.\n\nApplications are typically allowed to invoke other applications in Cloud Foundry by leaving the system and re-entering through the Load Balancer positioned in front of the Cloud Foundry routers. The Warden containers isolate processes, memory, and the file system. Each Warden container also provides a dedicated virtual network interface that establishes IP filtering rules for the app, which are derived from network traffic rules. This restrictive operating environment is designed for security and stability.\n\nIsolation is achieved by namespacing kernel resources that would otherwise be shared. The intended level of isolation is set such that multiple containers present on the same host are not aware of each other\u2019s presence. This means that these containers are given their own Process ID (PID), namespace, network namespace, and mount namespace. Resource control is managed through the use of Linux Control Groups (cgroups). Every container is placed in its own control group, where it is configured to use a fair share of CPU compared to other containers and their relative CPU share, and the maximum amount of memory it may use.\n\nThe DEA for each Warden container assigns a dedicated virtual network interface that is one side of a virtual Ethernet pair created on the host. The other side of the virtual Ethernet pair is only visible on the host from the root namespace. The pair is configured to use IPs in a small and static subnet.
