## The organization GSA OCISO and Valiant Solutions&colon;
## a. Identifies and selects the following types of information system accounts to support organizational missions/business functions&colon; [Assignment&colon; organization-defined information system account types];  
* * *   
### AWS Account Management  
* AWS accounts are managed through AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). Only users with a need to operate the AWS management console are provided individual AWS user accounts. There are no guest/anonymous, group, or temporary user accounts in AWS. Please see the Amazon Web Services US East/West and GovCloud System Security Plan for additional information.  
* 18F users must sign in to the account's signin URL by using their IAM user name and password. This signin URL is located in the Dashboard of the IAM console and must be communicated by the  18F AWS account's system administrator to the IAM user.  
* AWS Cloud Foundry security groups are documented in section 9.3 Types of Users.  
  
### Cloud Foundry PaaS Account Management  
* Cloud Foundry user and role accounts are managed and maintained through the  UAA Command Line Interface (UAAC). Cloud Foundry uses role-based access control with each role granting permissions in either a organization or an application space.  
* Cloud Foundry uses Application security groups (ASGs) to act as virtual firewalls to control outbound traffic from the applications in the deployment. A security group consists of a list of network egress access rules.  
* An administrator can assign one or more security groups to a Cloud Foundry deployment or to a specific space in an org within a deployment  
* Cloud Foundry user, organization, and application roles and security groups are documented in section 9.3 Types of Users.  
  
### Operating System Account (EC2) Management  
* Access to Amazon EC2 linux instances are managed by the use of EC2 key pairs and using SSH to access the local instance on the individual Linux, or appliance instance. Account types include individual user and system/application user accounts. Shared or group accounts are not permitted outside of default accounts such as local Administrators or root. There are no guest/anonymous or temporary user accounts.  
* Operating System user groups are documented in section 9.3 Types of Users.  
* Initial linux local root access is provided to AWS administrator account users only if they provide the key pair assigned to the linux EC2 instance and login using SSH.  
  
### 18F Account Management

### Cloud Foundry PaaS Account Management  
* Conditions for group membership for Cloud Foundry user accounts are based on requesting access within Github 18F tracking and ticketing system.  Once approved, the designated Cloud Foundry Administrators create the Cloud Foundry contact, add it to the appropriate organization.  After these steps are completed, the user can be assigned to projects and programs related to Cloud Foundry.  
* Account managers will be assigned for account groups in all environments, determined by the Cloud Foundry Project Manager and/or the Information System Owner.  
  
### Operating System Account (EC2) Management

## g. Monitors the use of information system accounts;  
* * *   
### AWS Account Monitoring  
* 18F has implemented AWS CloudWatch for its account monitoring. It allows 18F to monitor AWS resources in near real-time, including Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon EBS volumes, Elastic Load Balancers, and Amazon RDS DB instances. Metrics such as CPU utilization, latency, and request counts are provided automatically for these AWS resources. It allows 18F to supply logs or custom application and system metrics, such as memory usage, transaction volumes, or error rates.  
* Amazon CloudWatch functionality is accessible via API, command-line tools, the AWS SDK, and the AWS Management Console.  
  
### Cloud Foundry PaaS Account Management  
* 18F uses Steno for Cloud Foundry account logging. Steno is a shared logging service between the DEA, Cloud Controller The Cloud Foundry components share a common interface for configuring logs.  
* Loggregator/doppler, the Cloud Foundry component responsible for logging, provides a stream of log output from 18F applications and from Cloud Foundry system components that interact with  applications during updates and execution.  
  
### Operating System and network (EC2) (EBS) (ELB) Monitoring  
* 18F has implemented AWS CloudWatch  for basic monitoring of  Amazon EC2 instances. Basic Monitoring for Amazon EC2 instances- Seven pre-selected metrics at five-minute frequency and three status check metrics at one-minute frequency.  
* [object Object]  
* 18F has also implemented the use Auto Scaling and Elastic Load Balancing where Amazon CloudWatch provides Amazon EC2 instance metrics aggregated by Auto Scaling group and by Elastic Load Balancers.  
* Monitoring data is retained for two weeks, even if AWS resources have been terminated. This enables 18F to quickly look back at the metrics preceding an event of interest.  
* Basic Monitoring is already enabled automatically for all Amazon EC2 instances, and these metrics are accessed in either the Amazon EC2 tab or the Amazon CloudWatch tab of the AWS Management Console, or by using the Amazon CloudWatch API.
