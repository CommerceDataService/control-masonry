title: CA-8 - Penetration Testing
---
## The organization GSA OCISO and Valiant Solutions conducts penetration testing [Assignment&colon; organization-defined frequency] on [Assignment&colon; organization-defined information systems or system components].
### AWS/Cloud Foundry External Penetration Testing  
* For external public facing penetration testing, 18F must request permission from AWS using the AWS Vulnerability / Penetration Testing Request Form to conduct penetration test activities against its own Virtual Private Cloud infrastructure and follow the AWS Acceptable Use Policy.  
* Amazon requires customers to obtain authorization for penetration testing (or vulnerability assessments) both from or to their AWS resources. 1. AWS Acceptable Use Policy, http://aws.amazon.com/aup/ 2. AWS Penetration testng,  http://aws.amazon.com/security/penetration-testing/  
* The form requires 18F to submit information about the instances to test, identify the expected start and end dates/times of the test, and requires 18F team members to read and agree to Terms and Conditions specific to penetration testing and to the use of appropriate tools for testing. The end date may not be more than 3 months from the start date of the pentest as stated by AWS.  
* AWS Security will then add 18 F’s source and destination addresses to a whitelist for the duration of the penetration test and will revoke white list privileges if they receive any complaints or reports about DoS attacks.  
* GSA ISO will perform external vulnerability scanning and penetration testing services for the 18F information systems per the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). It is also bound by the AWS penetration testing policy and procedures.  
  
### AWS/Cloud Foundry Internal Penetration Testing  
* For internal penetration testing inside 18 F's Virtual Private Cloud, 18F team members will conduct authenticated vulnerability scans, whitebox/greybox testing of the 18F environment using AWS friendly and approved assessment tools.  
* For compliance with NIST Publication 800-53 CA-8, Parameter 1 Penetration Testing of all 18F Infrastructure and Application Components will occur annually. Parameter 2 Penetration Testing of Publicly Accessible Infrastructure will be performed on the direction of the GSA ISSO.  
* 18F will use GSA CIO-IT Security 11-51  rev 2” Conducting Penetration Test exercises” procedural guide as a reference
