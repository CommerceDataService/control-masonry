satisfies:
  IA-2 (1): "AWS Multi-Factor Authentication (AWS MFA) provides an extra level of\
    \ security that customer agencies apply to their AWS environment. Customer agencies\
    \ can enable AWS MFA for their account and for individual users they have created\
    \ under their account. With AWS MFA enabled a user that signs into the FedCloud\
    \ Console will be prompted for their username and password, as well as for an\
    \ authentication code from their MFA device. Taken together, these multiple factors\
    \ provide increased security for customer agencies\u2019 AWS account settings\
    \ and resources."
  IA-2 (2): AWS multi-factor authentication (MFA) for non-privileged users of the
