satisfies:
  AC-2: Cloud Foundry accounts are managed through the User Account and Authentication
    (UAA) Server.
  IA-2: The UAA is the identity management service for Cloud Foundry. Its primary
    role is as an OAuth2 provider, issuing tokens for client applications to use when
    they act on behalf of Cloud Foundry users.
  SC-13: All traffic from the public internet to the Cloud Controller and UAA happens
    over HTTPS and operators configure encryption of the identity store in the UAA
  SC-28 (1): Operators configure encryption of the identity store in the UAA. When
    users register an account with the Cloud Foundry platform, the UAA, acts as the
    user store and stores user passwords in the UAA database using bcrypt. Bcrypt
    is a blowfish encryption algorithm, which enables cloud foundry to store a secure
    hash of your users' passwords.
